[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/97syuiai5ieh68nv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/markfirmware/freepascal-appveyor)
Build pascal firmware to run on raspberry pi, using the [ultibo](http://ultibo.org) derivative of [freepascal](http://freepascal.org). This repo particularly demonstrates the use of AppVeyor to conduct the build.

## Road Map

### Automation

#### Deliver build output to private raspberry farm for testing and return results to builder for reporting

#### Deliver build output to public raspberry farm for testing and return results to builder for reporting
